# v13.10.5: Minor

- Fixed client crashes due to possible item-named crashes in the Chest GUI. The UI will now recognize from 1 to 40 item ids.
- Added /verify. This command will allow you to verify using that way also. Aliases: /captcha.
- Fixed Hopper GUI from not appearing when accidentally glitching it out.
- Added generated customized verification messages, used for verifying your account. If you choose to ignore this, it'll kick you from the server for taking too long to verify.
- You can no longer use other commands except /verify and /captcha if you're not yet verified.
- When you're in the air, it will no longer glitch out. We're not using PlayerMoveEvent anymore for this system. We're now using setImmobile(), which is a more easier and better way to handle player movements.
- The server will no longer teleport you to spawn upon join.
- Remove inventory before opening a new inventory - This basically fixes the glitches with Hopper GUI's.
- The server will no longer send useless messages that will eventually get annoying, and will flood your chat.
- The Hopper GUI will no longer open on most Player events. This is due to opening inventories too quickyly, which means a client crash could potentially happen. We try to prevent this as much as we can.
- You will no longer take any damage whatsoever if you're not verified.
- /verify now works as expected. Before, it wouldn't open the GUI nonetheless.
- Your hunger will no longer go down if you're not verified.
- Added generateRandomisedItem() function. This function will allow the Verify inventory to check if a slot is empty or not. If it is, it'll attempt to add the empty slots to the inventory.
- Fixed air sometimes being placed inside the Verify nventory, therefore, it isn't an item. This very rarely happens, but now, it shouldn't happen at all.
