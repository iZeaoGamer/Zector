## V10.0 Update; Major
## NOTE:
# This update is a complete re-code of OP Prisons, and there are a lot of bugs that were fixed from the S4 update. We finally bring back OP Prisons with a new season, which should fix all the major bugs.
# API, and some of the changes are classed as "Major", not "Minor". Which may include a lot of featuring-changes made in this update.

- Recoded /enchant completely, added more customization to the /enchant command.
- Leveling toggle now relies on a slider, instead of input fields for less complicated, and buggy method.
- Added Remove Enchantment toggle to /enchant, where you can decide whether or not you want the enchantment to be removed from your weapon.
- Fixed internal server errors when executing /enchant.
- Fixed messages such as: "You are at the maximum enchantment level" appearing even if you're not at the maximum enchants levels. This way was buggy due to the Input field for adding onto the levels. This was a big mistake because some of the time, this used to easily be abused. Good thing I've recoded it completely, aye?
- Fixed remove Enchant toggler from not removing the enchant properly.
- Added a check to ensure whether or not the player's item in hand has enchantments or not before removing the enchant in /enchant. If has an enchant, an error message will return.
- Fixed internal server errors when trying to enchant / remove an enchantment from Experienced CE.
- Lazy Custom enchantment now works as expected, implemented new methods for Lazy CE, making it work better than before. Since the last method was messed up because it was relying on how much EXP a player had, instead of whether you've upgraded to the next level, and whether or not you've mined once or not after you leveled up. If break = one time after upgrade, it'll set to true, so the EXP Max didn't constantly keep decreasing every mine, and only once every levelup.
- Crafting sellable items now properly adds onto the amount of items you're auto selling.
- Added a new Custom Enchant: Auto Sell. There's two ways you can sell now.
1. /autosell - Free, which allows you to turn on/off automatic selling without the need of custom enchantments.
2. AutoSell CE - Can be useful for Custom enchantments related content.
- Inventory picking up items somewhat has a working items amount when selling them. (I say somewhat because it's in BETA, and isn't fully accurate.
- Added AutoSell to /enchant.
- Fixed a lot of bugs relating to Item count being zero when sold using Autosell.
- Added and fixed /shop.
- Protected all of the mines, and worlds required.
- Added Auto mine reset.
- Fixed an issue, where first join would always appear for this player even if they've joined before. (When I mean before, I mean like 5-10 minutes ago).
- Fixed a bug, where players would be able to pvp in plots.
- Hunger no longer drops for the player when they're in plots world. This was due to a bug where players couldn't eat in plot worlds. This is a temporary fix to this until I find a permanent fix for this issue.
- Fixed internal server error when accessing Auto Sell Enchant information from /enchant.
- Fixed description error made in Auto Sell.
- Update enchant description for AutoSell, it no longer reoccurs "inventory" twice in one description.
- Fixed webhooks join/leave messages for OP Prisons.
- LuckyBlocks can no longer be placed.
- Made LuckyBlocks functional.
- Fixed Tokens not being received when breaking some lucky blocks.
- Fixed slight money issues.
- Updated the messages to english, and corrected the grammar on the "won" messages from luckyblocks.
- Corrected /shop grammar to english, and corrected the grammar on the Shop messages.
- Fixed a bug with player that has spaces in their name from not receiving the tokens or money from luckyblocks.
- Sell Boosters should be working now. (Still expect to be some bugs, but most of it should work now).
- Fixed count reset for Sell boosters going to 0 when it shouldn't. (Tested, but the bug may randomly come back.)
- Fixed typo messages in crates.
- The new crates plugin now supports spaced player names.
- Fixed internal server error when interacting with the paper (Sell Booster).
- Fixed a lot of bugs relating to timer display for sell boosters.
- Added back Auto Inventory feature - When breaking blocks, it'll automatically go straight to your inventory instead of dropping on the ground.
- Auto Sell now supports Auto inventory items - It'll count the total items you have in your inventory before selling it.
- Fix spam issues relating to Auto Selling.
- Added a different Bin / trash system, less glitchy too!
- Imported The new PlayerVaults update that is on Factions to OP Prisons S5.
- Added a check to ensure sell boosters can only be used once at a time. This is to get rid of the nasty bugs relating to sell booster count resetting.
- Added hasStarted() check to ensure the sell booster cooldown still continues even upon every server restart.
- Added a notification to let the player on the server know once they're able to use their next sell booster again.
- Fixed timer display upon Sell Booster receive.
- Fixed Inventory from not being sold properly if you toggle on AutoSell inventory feature in /autosell.
- Nerfed some CE's down to prevent anymore super OP items, and tools.
- Fixed some minor dupes relating to Items not going directly to your inventory.
- PvPMine has been slightly changed, thanks to @ItsYTWolfie for the help!
- PvP is now enabled in the PvPMine, not just some parts. Tested by me and @ItsYTWolfie.
- Removed ScoreBoard because for some reason, it caused server lag issues. We may add this back soon, we're not sure yet.
- Nerfed the rankup prices! It's now possible to rankup to places.
- A lot more things are now sellable. ;D
- Charity enchantment now broadcasts every 60 seconds per mine / break. This is to prevent spam. (Thanks to @ItsYTWolfie again for that suggestion)
- Charity enchantment now detects the total amount of tokens given to the player after the every 60 seconds cooldown. This also includes charity giving the total amount of tokens to the online players after the 60 seconds cooldown is over, instead of giving the online players tokens instantly.
- Fixed drops not going straight into your inventory if the inventory feature is disabled in /autosell.
- Fixed Mine Prefix from not appearing in chat.
- Fixed conflicting /fly command from reappearing.
- Fixed conflicting /nick command from reappearing.
- /feed now lasts longer before the hunger drops.
- Added a reminder LIVE on how long your sell booster lasts for, it counts live too! (It will display as a tip).
- Added a expired message notice LIVE for Sell boosters.
- Fixed Vote Party!
- Fixed server crashes relating to vote party.
- Fixed internal server error when using /vote claim, and when it's on the maximum votes left until vote party.
- Fixed Sell Boosters from not functional when received from Vote Party.
- You can now get x10 sell boosters from vote party.
- Receiving crate keys now work in Vote party.
- Fortune now works on most blocks.
- You can now receive x10 Vote keys from voting.
- Sell boosters no longer give you more than one per: Crate opening / receive, per vote party receive, and per command give.
- Fixed a bug, where the notification of expiration with sell boosters would popup even though You never had the sell booster before, so notifications would come up randomly upon server restart.
This would only occur upon every server restart, no matter if you had the sell booster before or not.
- Fixed sell booster timer from continuously counting into negatives.
- Clean-up join messages - Won't notice much of a difference in-game. It's the code that had been changed a bit.
- Fixed players being teleported to the void upon their first join on OP Prisons.
- Fixed player movement issues with the latest MCPE v1.14.30 bug - You should no longer experience player movement that is standing still; There may be some bugs relating to this because it's a patch method within the plugins that fixes this until MCPE releases a new update containing this fix.
- Fixed plots world not being loaded upon every server restart.
- Made a temporary fix for Playervaults not opening for players that have a rank. It'd only let them have access to Player vault 2 and 1. The reason why I say "Temporary fix", is because the permission grouping system is currently broken for PlayerVaults. I'm not sure when the author of the plugin will fix this. But I hope it will be soon.
- Added a pickaxe texture animation upon join, just like the Prisons style!
- Send welcome title to player once the onScreen Texture animation pops up.

- EXP will now go directly to your inventory upon mining.
- EXP will now go directly to your inventory upon player kill.
- XP Bottles will now pop XP directly to your inventory.
- Fixed a major bug, where opening crates and then instantly going offline would crash the server.
- Recoded PlayerVaults permissions completely.
- Recoded permission grouping.
- We’ve added a new permission node called: playervaults.vault.unlimited. This permission node will give you access to all playervaults without requiring op or any other extra permission nodes. You can also add negative before that permission node to disable operators having access to all playervaults, and then adding playervaults.vault.<max_vault>
- You no longer require to add any extra permissions. Example: Giving players access to 3 playervaults, by adding playervaults.vault.2, and playervaults.vault.3. You can now add for example: playervaults.vault.12 to give the user or group access to PV’s 1-12. This will make it so you no longer have to add any extra permissions to the specific player or group.
- Fixed permissioning group from only giving the player access to Pv 1-2, since before, it was looking for the lowest ranking permission. Now, we’ve removed those type of groups, and just implemented it into numbers. 5 for access to PV 1-5, etc.
- Changed permissioning node from playervaults.vault to vault.unlimited, and vault.<max_vault> for less longer permission node. - If none of you have those PVS and you were a rank previously which had those once V10 releases, DM me. Thank you!
- Ban and Mute times now calculate properly when banning / muting a player.
- Added back the use of Anti-VPNS (in BETA)

- Clean-up a lot of the plugins we don’t need.
- Fixed /invsee from becoming a normal chest.
- Fixed /enderinvsee from not responding, and simply not opening.
