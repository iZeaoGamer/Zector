# v13.10.3: Minor

- /silentchest now works flawlessly. You won’t hear any chest open/closing sounds, and any other sounds that could impact on the other player’s suspicion.

- Improved /silentchest, you won’t be able to hear anymore sounds.

- All Faction related chats has been moved to #faction-chat due to other players knowing and abusing the system.

- Destroy particles along with: Break and place sounds are now disabled when you have /silentchest turned on. That way, there’s no way anyone could find out you’re close to them.

- Moved hasSilentChest() and setSilentChest() to the Base player::class.

- Senior admins can now set ranks
