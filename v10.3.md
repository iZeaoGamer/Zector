## V10.3 Update; Minor

- Fixed creepers not being able to be exploded using flint and steel. (Factions only)
- Fixed creepers not being able to explode, but it'll die anyways from flint and steel. (Factions only)
- Fixed enchantment display from not disappearing if there's no enchantments on the pickaxe. This bug was introduced in season 5 or 4, which I managed to fix. This bug was only on the OP Prisons server.
