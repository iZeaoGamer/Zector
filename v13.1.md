## v13.1; Minor Update
- Added back Slappers NPCS ;D
- Added welcome message (floating text) along with the player count total on the network.
- Moved Hub Server to a new host (Will do the same for Hybrid as of v14 / Season 2).
- Redirected ips: play.zectorpe.net and play.zectorpe.ml to the new host.

NOTE
The play.zectorpe.ml domain may take some time for it to fully update. But the newest and latest domain should be working perfectly with the new host.

- Increased the Max slots on the hub server to 100.
- Turned on coordinates because why not? ;c
- Force gamemode to survival.
- Update Welcome message every 5 seconds to prevent lag.
