# Welcome to a brand new update v13.0. In this update, we create a new server named OP factions. This is Season 10, since we're continuing from where we left off previously.
# This update also brings in so many Custom enchantments (Compared to OP Factions S9), Envoys, LuckyBlocks, Bosses, and so much more!

## Here is the new v13.0 update changelog:
- Recoded Scoreboards to make it function, and add proper API methods for scoreboards.
- ScoreBoard title now has a colored name.
- Remove multiple scoreboard plugin names, and just implement as one scoreboard plugin.
- Added /pvphud - Shows PvP Scoreboard Information, which show two type of main informations:
1. Durabilities for Armor.
2. Cooldowns for Enchanted golden apples, Golden apples, and Ender pearls.

- Show colored rank name along with the player name on scoreboard.
- Removed a lot of useless shit that didn't need to be on the scoreboard. (Upto 9 lines).
- Added Ender Pearls cooldown, functional as well.
- Fixed enchanted golden apples and Golden apples from displaying the wrong cooldown message and timer.
- Added envoys 2.0.0 recode (I'm mentioning it here because these changes are differences from S9 of OP Factions and S10 of OP Factions).
- Added LuckyBlocks to the server! 
- Removed a lot of useless plugins - We're now on 76 plugins. Before, we were on 116 plugins. Much big improvements.
- Moved server hosting providers to Wither hosting. People say it's good, so we hope they're right.
- Recoded AutoSell to 2.0.0 and how it works! Once again, but should be the fix this time. ;D
- Removed Sell Boosters for now.
- Removed compatibility support for SellAll plugin, and added compatibility with Shop plugin (/shop).
- Auto Sell should no longer lag the server. (Untested).
- There should be no more /shop exploits along with /sell exploits.
- Added a complete /sell recode.
- Added /sell <hand/all/auto>. I'll explain what each of them do:
* hand - Sells items in your hand.
* all - Sells everything that's sellable in your inventory.
* auto - Toggles on/off autosell. Yes, this is now combined with /sell.

- Removed SellAll plugin due to us wanting to be a custom server. ;D + A lot of exploits with this were issued.
- Removed inventory option due to less confusions.
- Fixed crash upon scoreboards.
- Added abbrieviated balance / money. SO for example, if you have $1000 or $1,000, it'll now display as $1k.
- AutoSell now works as expected.
- Fixed AutoSell from still working even if autosell is turned off.
- AutoSell (/sell auto) is now for certain ranks only (Most likely for donators only).
- Fixed crash upon mining LuckyBlocks.
