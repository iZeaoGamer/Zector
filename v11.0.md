## V11.0; MAJOR

# Note:
# We have made a lot of changes over the new v11.0 update, which fixes bugs, and a new Season of OP Prisons coming soon!


As a part of the v11 update for the network, there will be a new season of OP Prisons, which is S6. This season enhances many bug fixes, improvements, and a lot of reworks for Custom Enchants. We're reworking some of them due to the fact there were some useless ones, and some which we didn't think we need. We're also adding a few new CE's as well.

- TokenPlus and KeyPlus are no longer commonly activated when used. (More with this will be added soon).
- Added new CE: Transfusion. Desc: Chance to upgrade ore to the next level. Example: If you mine coal ore, you’ll get Iron ingot because that’s the next level. Type: Tools

- Fixed internal server errors when executing an error message.
- Fixed Sell Boosters from not being activated when interacted.
- Fixed internal server errors when using Explosive CE.
- Explosive CE no longer destroys blocks. It only damages the enemy, not the attacker or the blocks.
- Added new Slider: Sell Booster Timer, where you can now set the amount of sell booster timers in seconds. Yes, this will cost more. So keep an eye out!
- Sell Boosters from conversions are now accurate in terms with Sell Booster timers.
- Fixed plots world not loading upon every server restart.
- Fixed crates from resetting every server restart.
- Added /ot to the server!
- Fixed internal server errors when using /mban.
- Added kits to /kit, better, and less OP.
- Add new PlayerVaults new permissioning system! As seen previously, but for some reason was removed. Not sure why, but it's back now, with its permission limits.

- Added on Screan texture animation upon player join!

- World Border only works in Plots.
- Added new option: spawn-location. This option allows you to decide whether the world border range depends on /setworldspawn, instead of specifying the coordinates, and depending on default level spawnpoint location.
- The range (in blocks) in plots, is 1k. This is simply because there should be a maximum of plots intotal, instead of counting infinite. This just lowers the usage of our resources when it comes down to databases.

- Added Kit shop to /kit.
- Donator kits are the only kits that are Buyable from /kit (Kit shop category). You'll need to receive Youtube kits by applying for YouTube Rank.

- Fixed OP Prisons Info not showing up on the scoreboard.
- Fixed crash upon player join.
- Added a brand new offenses system to /mban and /mmute. How this works?:
Everyone on the server get’s 0 offenses. If a player get’s banned or muted, it’ll add onto their offense.
With Temp bans and temp mutes, if the user get’s banned for Kill Aura for 60 days (example), and they have more than one offense already, then it’ll double the ban time. Same goes for Mute times also.
The more offenses the player has, the more it’ll double their ban or mute.
- Revamped Mute lengths - Thanks @Bubbly for that!
- Fixed typos to do with /enchant saying the wrong item.
- Fixed a bug, where /converter wouldn’t work, and would come up with no permission error. Thanks for reporting this issue, @ExoCrafter123!

- Fixed /mytokens from requiring a permission node. Should be fixed now. ;D
- Updated warp for PvP Mine.
- Fixed crash with Bunny Custom Enchant.
- Temporary fix for Enchantments and CE's from not working properly. This would have to do with Pocketmine using API Version v3.11.2 and above which made enchantments not work. Still working towards this fix for future API upgrades.
- Fixed bug with zombies having a AI look, but broken.
- Removed the self advertisement in /profile without using any args.
- Added message upon opening your own profile.
