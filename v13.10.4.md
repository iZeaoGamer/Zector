# v13.10.4: MINOR

- Server captcha will now kick you from the server if you get the answer incorrect. 
- Server captcha will now automatically kick you from the server if you've been idle with the Captcha for 1 minute.
- Fixed bosses crashing the server. This was to do with the Server captcha, which is now fixed.
