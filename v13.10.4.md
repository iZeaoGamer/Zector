# v13.10.4: MINOR

- Added Server Captcha to the server. How this works: Upon every player join, you're required to verify yourself using our unique Item GUI selection. In this verification, you have to click on the correct item it states. If you don't, you'll be kicked from the server. This also includes: Being idle for 1 minute when you've not fully verified yet. Once you've verified, you can continue playing the server.
- Server captcha will now kick you from the server if you get the answer incorrect. 
- Server captcha will now automatically kick you from the server if you've been idle with the Captcha for 1 minute.
- Fixed bosses crashing the server. This was to do with the Server captcha, which is now fixed.
