## v13.2: MINOR UPDATE
- Fixed /gamemode from becoming broken.
- Fixed alias commands: /gmc, /gms, /gma, etc from becoming broken.
- Fixed /homeadmin being usable by anyone.
- /alias now works directly from Helper rank and above.
- Fixed PlayerVaults from becoming broken. (As of today).
- PlayerVaults no longer depends on your rank only.
- Fixed playervaults permissioning not working - Yes, we've changed permissions for player vaults as a whole.
- Added permission grouping.
- PlayerVaults now comes with new permissions! Here's the new permissioning (From @Management Team to use for future):
* vault.<rank_name>
NOTE
The <rank_name> argument has to be lowercase for this to work.

Example: vault.guest for setting pv's for guest players, vault.lord for setting pv's for Lord rank, and so on.

- Fixed /realname permission.
- Fixed /gamemode permission.
- You can now obtain /sell auto from receiving Zector rank or permission, in which you can retrieve using /rankup.
- Fixed exploit with retrieving ores or ingots even if your inventory is full. (Will work more on this soon.)
