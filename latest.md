## V11.2 UPDATE; Minor

- Fixed crash on voteparty.
- Fixed a bug, where vote parties would cause the server to crash whenever your inventory is full, and a pickaxe is attempting to be added to your inventory.
- Pickaxes will now drop out of your inventory when you're full on inventory. (VoteParty)
- Added AFK detector to OnlineTime! How this works: When you're A.F.K for a certain amount of time, the online time will stop your activity, and pause it until you become un A.F.K
