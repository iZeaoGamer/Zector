## V9.3 UPDATE; Minor
- Fixed the 1.14.30 bug to do with player movement, you may now update. (Untested, but should work.)
- Fixed bosses dupe glitch.
- Removed Cactus due to the dupe glitch with bosses.
- Fixed the spawn. In reality, no harm done, except when a certain someone griefed spawn, but they were banned, and all should be resolved and fixed.
- Your gamemode will now update to survival mode upon every player join. This is for security reasons, and if at any point a player is in creative mode, when they shouldn't be.
- Fixed stack count resetting bug with spawners. (Tested to work ;D)
