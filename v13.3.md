# v13.3; MINOR UPDATE

- Fixed /duel from causing your client to give an internal server error.
- Fixed server crashes when teleporting to the duels arena / accepting a duel request.
- /trade is now fixed. You can now use it freely!

NOTE
For those that don't know this yet, /duel doesn't actually make you lose your items. You get to keep your items, but STR goes up (If you kill a player in duels), and the STR goes down (If you die in a duels arena). Just like it would normally do if you're just killing people / dying to people.
