# v13.10.2: Minor

**Reports 2.0.0 Rewrite**

- This update was due a long time ago, but I never had time to do it. This took just under a hour to do, and it's complete.
- This reports rewrite update also includes:
* A limitation on how many people you can report a day. 5 is the maximum to prevent abuse. We may increase this limit in the future.
* New usages: Type: /report <player> <reason>
* The <reason> section can now contain spaces in the report.
* All reports can now be dealt with anyone, depending on how severe it is, and whether or not it requires higherups.

**NOTE WITH REPORTS REWRITE**

- If anyone tries bypassing the limit, you/the person doing it will be banned for Abusing reports.

**Adding /silentchest**

- This update is quite massive, along with the changes it offers.
* All chests should now be silent. They may make a little noise, but that’s because it’s trying to cancel out the noise.  Yes, this is when you’re using /silentchest to turn it on.

**Who has access to /silentchest?**

Junior moderators and above.

**Vanish Updates**

- /v no longer depends on the permission. It now requires a rank only, a rank from Junior moderator and above.
- When in /v on, you will no longer hear the attacking / nodamage noise.
