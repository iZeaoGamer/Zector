## V9.1 UPDATE; Minor

- Fixed mining rewards, and its dupes.
- Fixed a dupe, where you could throw mining rewards in lava, and you would get a stack of the mining rewards.
- Coded MiningRewards differently. We've made it so instead of dropping the item, you'll now click on the ground to receive the appropriate rewards. NOTE that previous mining reward items won't work. You'll need to use the new system's item reward.
- Fixed dupes with bosses.
- Removed Missile from CE's due to bugs containing this.
- Removed Parachute, ForceField, and Volley due to bugs.
- Fixed nether and end from not generating the proper worlds.
- Fixed a dupe with the new mining rewards system, where you can receive keys from it whilst still keeping the mining reward item. Basically gaining unlimited amounts.
- Fixed a crash, where /f admin addstrength won't check for if the amount of str the player or console entered is numeric or not. Now, this check is fully implemented.
- Fixed /f claim from becoming broken, and unusable.
- You no longer require atlest 4 players in your faction to claim a plot.
- Fixed a bug, where claiming a faction would come up with the success message, but wouldn't actually claim the plot.
- Changed the faction plot size to 30 radius / blocks.
